# Stockr: A simple Shopify stock monitoring framework

WIP (TODO coming soon)

## Installation

```
$ git clone git@github.com:kfichter/stockr.git
$ cd stockr
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Basic usage

- Add proxies to proxies.txt (you WILL be temp banned by Shopify if you don't use proxies)
- Add a sitelist to sites/ (`sample.txt` shows format)
- Run a sitelist with `python3 main.py sitelistname.txt`
